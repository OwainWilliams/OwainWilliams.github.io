Hey there, Umbraco folks!

My name is Chriztian - in the Umbraco Community you might know me as the steward
of the [Christmas Calendar][24DAYS] or as a writer in [Skrift Magazine][SKRIFT].

If you're old enough to have used Umbraco versions 6 and below, you might have
had to ask a question or two on the XSLT forum and we _might just_ possibly
maybe have had a conversation or two, trying to find the answers... one of my
favorite things to do is to show someone how XSLT actually works (which is only
surpassed by teaching someone to play their favorite song on the guitar).

The "XSLT++" on my shirt refers to a presentation I did at a Danish Umbraco
festival in 2010 - as for the **ZX Spectrum** - well, that one really started
all this for me, so had to take that with me to the stage.
